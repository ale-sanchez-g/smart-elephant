# prompts.md â€” session prompts and outputs

This file is append-only. For every prompt the assistant uses to generate artifacts, append a short entry with these fields:

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
- Role: (assistant|user|system)
- Intent: one-line description of why the prompt was run
- Prompt (summary or full prompt)
- Output files: list of repo paths written or modified
