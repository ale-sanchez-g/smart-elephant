# Knowledge Pipeline User Stories

## Epic: AI Agent Knowledge Integration

Enable AI agents to access, search, and utilize organizational knowledge stored in a vector database to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

---

## User Story 1: Local Knowledge Data Store Access

**As an** AI agent  
**I want to** invoke a local knowledge data store that has specific knowledge about my organization  
**So that** I can provide accurate, organization-specific information in my responses

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI agent can connect to ChromaDB vector database
- [ ] Knowledge data store contains organizational documents and information
- [ ] Agent can query the data store using natural language queries
- [ ] Connection is secure and follows best practices
- [ ] Response time for queries is under 2 seconds for 95% of requests

### Technical Notes

- Use ChromaDB as the vector database backend
- Implement connection pooling for performance
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic

---

## User Story 2: Automatic Knowledge Base Search

**As an** AI agent  
**I want to** automatically search the knowledge base for relevant information when users ask questions  
**So that** I can provide comprehensive answers without manual intervention

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System automatically detects when a user query requires knowledge base lookup
- [ ] Semantic search finds relevant documents based on query intent
- [ ] Top K most relevant results are retrieved (configurable, default K=5)
- [ ] Search results include relevance scores
- [ ] System handles queries even when no relevant information is found

### Technical Notes

- Use Sentence Transformers to generate query embeddings
- Implement similarity search using cosine similarity
- Configure relevance threshold to filter low-quality matches
- Cache frequent queries for performance

---

## User Story 3: AI Response Integration with Search Results

**As an** AI agent  
**I want to** integrate search results into my responses  
**So that** users receive accurate, product-specific answers with proper context

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Retrieved documents are formatted and provided as context to the AI model
- [ ] AI responses cite sources when using knowledge base information
- [ ] System gracefully handles cases where no relevant information is found
- [ ] Response quality is maintained with knowledge integration
- [ ] System tracks which knowledge base entries are most frequently used

### Technical Notes

- Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern
- Format retrieved documents for optimal LLM consumption
- Include metadata (source, timestamp, relevance score) with responses
- Implement monitoring and analytics for knowledge base usage

## Supporting Stories

### Story 4: Document Ingestion

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** ingest organizational documents into the knowledge base  
**So that** AI agents have access to up-to-date information

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Support multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, Markdown, JSON)
- [ ] Documents are automatically chunked for optimal retrieval
- [ ] Embeddings are generated and stored in ChromaDB
- [ ] Ingestion process is idempotent (can be re-run safely)
- [ ] Batch ingestion supports large document sets

---

### Story 5: Knowledge Base Management

**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** manage the knowledge base (add, update, delete documents)  
**So that** the information remains current and accurate

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API endpoints for CRUD operations on documents
- [ ] Version control for document updates
- [ ] Ability to delete outdated information
- [ ] Search functionality to find existing documents
- [ ] Audit trail for all changes

---

### Story 6: Monitoring and Observability

**As a** system operator  
**I want to** monitor the health and performance of the knowledge pipeline  
**So that** I can ensure reliable service and identify issues early

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Metrics collected for query latency, throughput, and error rates
- [ ] Dashboards show knowledge base size and usage patterns
- [ ] Alerts configured for performance degradation
- [ ] Logs capture query patterns and errors
- [ ] Cost tracking for cloud resources

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Query latency: P95 < 2 seconds
- Throughput: 100 queries per second minimum
- Concurrent users: Support 50+ simultaneous queries

### Scalability

- Support 1M+ documents in knowledge base
- Horizontal scaling capability for increased load
- Efficient storage and retrieval at scale

### Security

- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Authentication and authorization for API access
- Role-based access control for knowledge base management
- Audit logging for compliance

### Reliability

- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Data backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Zero data loss guarantee
