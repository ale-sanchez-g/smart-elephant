# Knowledge Pipeline Implementation Plan

**Status:** Approved  
**Created:** 2025-10-24  
**Owner:** AI Agent  
**Reviewers:** Repository Owner

## Scope

Implement a knowledge pipeline system that enables AI agents to access and search organizational knowledge stored in a vector database. The system will use ChromaDB for storage, Sentence Transformers for embeddings, and semantic search capabilities to provide relevant context for AI responses.

## Deliverables

- [x] AIDLC repository structure (aidlc-docs/)
- [ ] User stories for knowledge pipeline features
- [ ] Component design documents for:
  - [ ] ChromaDB vector database integration
  - [ ] Sentence Transformers embedding service
  - [ ] Semantic search capability
- [ ] AWS deployment infrastructure:
  - [ ] Terraform code for infrastructure provisioning
  - [ ] GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository follows AIDLC structure with proper documentation
2. User stories clearly define AI agent knowledge access requirements
3. Component designs specify technical architecture and integration points
4. Terraform code can provision necessary AWS resources
5. GitHub Actions workflows automate deployment to AWS infrastructure
6. All code follows best practices and includes proper documentation

## Timeline

- **Start Date:** 2025-10-24
- **Target Completion:** 2025-10-24
- **Review Date:** 2025-10-24

## Dependencies

- AWS account for infrastructure deployment
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Python environment for development

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AWS costs exceed budget | Medium | Use cost-effective instance types, implement auto-scaling |
| Vector database performance issues | High | Design with appropriate indexing, test at scale |
| Deployment failures | Medium | Implement proper testing, rollback procedures |

## Notes

This is a greenfield implementation following the workflow outlined in the repository README. The implementation will create all necessary infrastructure and code from scratch.
